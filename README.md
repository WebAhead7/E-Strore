<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

#### Online Shopping

##### SHOP & SHIP ALL OVER THE WORLD!

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

We ship to over 200 locations worldwide! Thanks to our partnership with Borderfree Ecommerce, a trusted third-party service, you can send your estore.com purchases around the globe with ease and confidence. When you place an international order, your transaction will be with Borderfree, but if you have questions, concerns or customer service needs, our macys.com associates will be happy to help you!

You can shop estore.com in your preferred currency–even if it doesn't match the currency of the shipping destination. Your order total is guaranteed at the exchange rate set when your order is placed. Orders shipped to the United States must have a U.S. credit card billing address to be placed online.
